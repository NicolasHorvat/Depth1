# Underwater Depth Prediction â€“ FLSea Canyons

This project tackles **underwater depth prediction** using the **FLSea Canyons Dataset** ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viseaonlab/flsea-vi)).  
It is inspired by [this research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10611007).

-> The Canyons Dataset is **not included** in this repository. Download it from Kaggle and specify the path in the scripts.
